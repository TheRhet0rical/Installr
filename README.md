# **Installr** ⬇️ - Release *2.1*
Installr is a web application designed to ease the *daunting* task of downloading multiple items at one time.

Instead of doing the grueling task of downloading the same 15 apps on your new computer, or multiple computers at a time, Installr gets rid of the time-consuming task of going to all these websites and condenses them into a one-time setup task that installs everything in the click of one button.

## **Note** 📒
Since the website will attempt to open multiple items at one time, you will need to **disable your pop-up blocker**. Usually, when you first run it, it will let you know in your URL bar. After you do this, everything should work fine from there.
