# **Installr** - *Version 1.1-4/27*
Installr is a multi-application installer tool that gets rid of constantly installing multiple applications online.

Instead of doing the grueling task of downloading the same 15 apps on your new computer, or multiple computers at a time, Installr gets rid of the time-consuming task of going to all these websites and condenses them into a one-time setup task that installs everything in the click of one button.

## **Disclaimer**
Since Installr is still in active development, some features will be implemented over time. These features are listed below.
- [ ] File caching of link list, instead of implementing each item every time. Definitely coming soon since without this it's ruins the purpose.

## **Instructions, In Depth**
All you do is enter the link of the install or website, and when the **Run Install** button is clicked, it'll redirect you to every website in that list. Oh, and due to security reasons which *i think only consists with Google Chrome*, your pop-up blocker will have to be disabled beforehand.
